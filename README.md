# DY_samples_analysis
DY samples analysis
DY 2018, 2017 are analyzed
Z mass peak is studied in different pT, eta, phi

### programs_DSCB
Z mass fit is done by DSCB and stored in programs_DSCB folder

### program_smearing
Further studies are done by adding biases to the pT of gen leptons and Z mass is reconstructed with these biases
And final reconstructed Z mass fit is studied in program_smearing
